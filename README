webgrep is a simple tool for scraping websites from the command line

Setup:
> sudo easy_install webgrep 


Example:
Finding number of ratings for a book on goodreads

Find the location of the 'Ratings' in the html by using the -g option:
> webgrep.py -g 'Ratings' -u "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4588.Extremely_Loud_and_Incredibly_Close"
match,location
"267,896 Ratings"," 1,3,1,3,5,3,7,1,3,5,14,1,0"

Now use that location value (" 1,3,1,3,5,3,7,1,3,5,14,1,0") as the -l argument to look in the same location on a different page
> webgrep.py -l " 1,3,1,3,5,3,7,1,3,5,14,1,0" -u "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1618.The_Curious_Incident_of_the_Dog_in_the_Night_Time"
"778,683 Ratings"
